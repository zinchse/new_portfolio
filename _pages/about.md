Hello! 👋

I'm master student majoring in Computer Science. Developing intelligent optimization systems is what I do in `Huawei` :) 

I am currently specializing in database acceleration. Using machine learning and discrete optimization techniques, I'm improving existing solutions and developing new ones. 

In free time I listen to rap 🎧 and make bad jokes 🤦‍♂️ 

(and leetcode, ofc ... 💻)
