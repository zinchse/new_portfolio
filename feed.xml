<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>The purpose of this text is to find answers to the following questions (yes, these questions are not about the same thing…):</p>
<ul>
  <li>is parallelism possible in python?</li>
  <li>is true parallelism possible in python?</li>
  <li>is true parallelism possible in python for cpu bound tasks?</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time we will get acquainted with GIL and understand why it is so important. We will also learn why it may be useful to avoid it. And of course, we’ll learn how to do it (since it’s important). At the end, I will talk a bit about funny features of synchronization primitives in Python (I came across them while studying the topic, then I have to share them with someone).</p>

<h3 id="true-parallelism">True Parallelism</h3>

<p>Let’s begin by defining what <em>real parallelism</em> is. I will take it to mean the possibility of executing several program instructions at once at a particular moment of time. This can be done, for example, when there are several processor cores.</p>

<p>More detailed: in the end, any program is represented as a set of some machine operations, and, obviously, someone has to execute them (it can be a TPU / GPU; but in our case it will be a CPU device, aka processor). In modern systems, a CPU has several cores at once. And I will call true parallelism the case when we achieve a gain in the speed of program execution due to their use.</p>

<h3 id="non-true-parallelism">Non-true Parallelism</h3>

<p>One might ask, then what is non-true parallelism? For example, if we execute 2 programs on one processor core and switch between them so quickly that the user does not notice anything, it can be called parallelism - from the user’s point of view 2 programs work simultaneously. But in reality there is only one program running at each moment of time and such parallelism is not true. It. is. an. illusion. But it can be useful. And yet it’s completely inappropriate for a scenario where we need to speed up a <em>single heavy task</em> (unfortunately, this case isn’t rare).</p>

<h1 id="threads-vs-process">Threads vs Process</h1>

<p>The two main classes of tasks are <em>cpu and io (input/output) bound</em> tasks. The first class requires CPU work most of the time, while in the second type of tasks waiting for some third-party services (drive, database, etc.) to respond plays a significant role.</p>

<p>There is a fundamental difference between io and cpu bound tasks: <em>io bound tasks can be easily and efficiently parallelized</em> if you pause execution of one code branch at the moment of waiting for the response of some third-party service and switch to another. In case of a cpu bound task this trick <strong>will not work</strong> - if we give the processor core to someone else, the progress of our execution will not move anywhere and we will <strong>increase</strong> the total running time.</p>

<p>Let’s make sure I’m not making anything up.</p>

<h3 id="example-1---io-bound-task">Example 1 - io bound task</h3>

<p>As an io bound task, we will use a function that <del>just sleeps</del> simulates waiting for an external service to respond.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>

<p>But cpu bound tasks are not accelerated by creating additional threads (at least in python). So I didn’t lie to you.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>Ok, we get it. There are some problems with threads in Python. Then just use processes and be happy. But wait… Let’s see in real time how much memory is used to support a python process:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Total Python's memory: 61.703125 MB
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s on the order of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20mB</code> per process (I had 3 process when i called it)! That’s a lot, to put it mildly. Maybe it will be possible to make cpu bound task friends with threads?</p>

<h1 id="threads--cpu-bound-task">Threads &amp; cpu bound task</h1>

<p>To really realize what is the reason for such interaction of threads and cpu bound tasks in python, we should dive into the process of python code execution in more detail. It will not be easy. It will be difficult. It will be <em>uninteresting</em>. But we will do it. Then it will become obvious what is the bottleneck in the entire system. And to get around that limitation, we’ll resort to a <em>secret technique</em>…</p>

<h3 id="pythons-code-execution"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Python</code>s code execution</h3>

<p>The process of code execution in Python can be broken down into several main steps:</p>

<p><strong>1. In first, we just write the code, for example, in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.py</code> file:</strong></p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">The real science</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>2. Secondly, this code is compiled into some intermediate representation (byte code), which is something between source code and assembly language; in our case we will get a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.pyc</code> with the following contents:</strong></p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> 0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (print)
 2 LOAD_CONST               1 ('The real science.')
 4 CALL_FUNCTION            1
 6 POP_TOP
 8 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
10 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>3. After that, Python Virtual Machine is started, which, reading instructions from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pyc</code> file, generates hardware-specific machine code:</strong></p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>11101011101101010110
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can see that to correctly translate instructions from byte code to machine code, we need a separate program – <em>interpreter</em>. And for each process, this interpreter is <em>unique</em>. Therefore, at no point in time can multiple python threads execute instructions on the processor - each of those instructions needs the help of the interpreter, which is one. Moreover, each thread acquires a special <em>Global Interpreter Lock</em> to, for example, <em>simplify memory management</em>: if we know that only one thread is running at any given moment, it is easy to keep track of the reference count of all objects, and as a consequence - it’s very easy for us to understand which objects can be removed.</p>

<h3 id="avoiding-gil-via-cython">Avoiding GIL via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cython</code></h3>

<p>Good. Now we can see that the root of the problem is the need to interpret byte code. What if we somehow write code that can be turned into machine code without the need for interpretation? For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C++</code> code does not require this extra step. Indeed, we can use a special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cython</code> tool that allows us to write code using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code>-like syntax that can be executed bypassing the interpreter.</p>

<p>What do we end up with? If we have the ability to write code that won’t lock the interpreter (e.g. using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cython</code>), then already <strong>multiple python threads can be executed on different cores at the same time</strong>! And this is exactly what we wanted. Let’s try to do all this.</p>

<p>I recently <a href="https://zinchse.github.io/blog/2023/yandex-training/">[talked]</a> about the moment when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yandex.Trainings</code> put me on the spot. The last problem in this contest can be reduced to a BFS on a state graph. I got into it in a minute, spent two more on the code. And? My first submit got <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MLE</code> (memory limit error). I thought: “Okay, I’ll fix it”. I optimized the code and… I got MLE again! On a different test, but there is no difference. All the time of the contest I was beating myself up over it, thinking: “What the hell is this?”. But it didn’t work. I guess sometimes even I can be wrong…</p>

<p>A couple months after that, I went back to the task, looked at it with fresh eyes and came to the conclusion that I was doing everything right! Mostly the task was passed in C++, and few people had encountered this problem. But by chance I still came across a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.py</code> solution that passed all the tests! And it implemented exactly what I tried, except for one thing. The only thing that made the solution different was that the description of a vertex of the state graph was compressed from a tuple to a <strong>single integer</strong>. It is conceptually <strong>impossible</strong> to describe a graph vertex with less than 3 numbers. However, given that each of these three numbers is guaranteed to be in a known small range, it is possible to encode all numbers with one! In fact, this approach exploits an interesting feature of the hardware:</p>

<div align="center">
<i>No matter how large a number is stored in a variable, physically it always occupies a certain space!</i>
</div>

<p><br />
<em>And how we can use it?</em> Let’s take a look… <br />
Suppose we have numbers \(a\) and \(b\), each of which is in the range \([0; \, 10^d - 1]\). Then both of these numbers can be represented by a single number \(z\) as follows \(z = zip(a, b) = a \cdot 10 ^ {d} + b\). If \(d=2\), \(a=1\) and \(b=12\), then \(z=zip(a, b) = 112\). By the number \(z\) we can always recover \(a\) and \(b\) as follows:</p>

<p>Although asymptotically the occupied memory remains the same, at large sizes the savings of even a factor of constant can be extremely noticeable!</p>

<p>*note that we assume all numbers are positive, otherwise we would need an extra bit.</p>

<h1 id="padding">Padding</h1>

<p>Now we has convinced that studying the features of physical storage of objects in memory can be useful. However, now we will get acquainted with an even more interesting technique.</p>

<p>In the real world, the hardware reads several consecutive bytes (often 4) at once on each read operation. Moreover, on a number of architectures, it can only read 4 bytes from a position that is a multiple of 4. That is (<em>when indexing bytes from 1</em>), on some architectures it is basically <strong>impossible to read bytes [2-5] at a time</strong>. In this case, if we want to store an integer of size 4 bytes, the most efficient way to store it is to place it in consecutive 4 bytes starting at a multiple of 4. Why? Because it’s the only way we can read all the bytes of a number, spending <em>only 1 read operation</em> (see picture below). Any other way of storing information would take more! And the most efficient way to store a \(b\) byte number is to arrange it starting at the byte whose number is a multiple of \(b\) (the reason for this phenomenon is already very technical and we will omit it). Arranging objects so that they satisfy this condition is called <strong>alignment</strong>.</p>

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="/assets/img/alignment_example.png" alt="alignment example" width="450px" />
        <figcaption>
            An example of where additional read operations
            <br />
             may be required if bytes are misaligned.
        </figcaption>
    </div>
</figure>

<p>Okay, easy and simple. Although… Stop! What should we do with structures whose fields have different sizes? The requirements for their alignment are <strong>different</strong> and we can’t store the fields right behind each other. To combat this, we will have to use <strong>padding</strong> technique. This consists of a) locating the beginning of the structure in a byte whose address is a multiple of the size of the largest field in the structure and b) keeping all fields aligned by introducing “garbage” bytes if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Suppose we have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyStruct</code> structure with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">char</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> fields. The first field must be located starting from the byte divisible by 4 (because of the peculiarities of reading by quadruples). But the second field can’t follow it because of its alignment requirement! So we have to leave 3 bytes empty! That is, we only use 5 bytes, but take up 8.  As much as 37.5% of the allocated space is garbage! Knowing this can be useful, because by rearranging the fields we can compress the space occupied by the structure! Why this is so - see example below.</p>

<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">MyStruct</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>For the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyLargeStruct</code> structure, we need as many as 6 additional padding bytes! The first 3 are for aligning the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> field on a multiple of 4. But besides that we need 3 bytes after the last <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">char</code>. Why? It’s not so trivial anymore. Suppose we want to create an array with elements of this structure. To support field alignment of all objects at once and easy addressing, it is very convenient to keep the size of the structure divisible to the size of its largest field. In our case, the size of the largest field is 4, and we have to add 3 bytes of alignment at the end. But for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyStructSmall</code>, we only need 2 bytes of padding at the end of it. That is, just by rearranging the order of the fields, we took 3 times less additional bytes!</p>

<h1 id="bloom-filter">Bloom filter</h1>

<p>Even with the most efficient data arrangement, in some cases we will have unused memory space due to the hardware architecture. This means that we can occupy it with something useful! For example, add new fields in those places that will be occupied anyway.</p>

            Knowledge about physical data storage can be used to improve
            <br />
            the efficiency of an algorithm. For example, we can add new
            <br />
            fields in places where padding will be used anyway.
        </figcaption>
    </div>
</figure>

<p>In practice I faced such a situation when fields of my structure were hash values of some object. My structures were often used for expensive comparison of objects, which was often avoided by hash matching check. By introducing fields with the values of other hash functions, I was able to significantly reduce collisions. In fact, I turned my comparison algorithm into something very similar to the Bloom filter. This <strong>improved</strong> my system performance, and <strong>I didn’t waste a single byte of extra space</strong> !</p>

<p>Some might argue: “Why would You go off in the direction of the Bloom filter? Ok, You have more space, take a more complex hash function. You might even have fewer collisions with it!”. Yeah. Thanks for the idea, but for backward compatibility, I had to leave the previous field as it is. That’s the main beauty of this approach - with the help of memory management knowledge You can <strong>add new functionality</strong> to Your structure <strong>without any overhead and consequences</strong>!</p>

<p>I was going to try to get in the <strong>habit</strong> of <em>solving the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leetcode</code> problem before breakfast</em>. And do it 100 times in a row to start with.</p>

<p>On about day 42-45 of my venture, <strong>I stopped seeing any progress</strong>. I learned to test my code. I learned to estimate asymptotics by constraints. I learned to find the right patterns. And the whole idea started to seem like a <strong>waste of time</strong>. I decided to see it through to the end and spent the remaining 60 days solving problems with almost no interest or excitement. I would give this idea a 4/10 rating now (<em>and that’s why I don’t recommend repeating</em>). But the first 40 days were really <strong>awesome</strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s what new things I got out of it.</p>

<h3 id="leetcode-tasks-are-best-not-solved-on-the-leetcode-platform-im-serious"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Leetcode</code> tasks are best not solved on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leetcode</code> platform. I’m serious.</h3>

<p>That <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run</code> / <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">submit</code> button completely shuts off the desire to think. The best I’ve come up with is to <strong>copy</strong> the problem description to an external editor (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> / <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notepad</code> / <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jupyter</code>, etc.) and <strong>write</strong> the solution there. Moreover, when the solution was written, it need to be <strong>tested</strong>. This approach slows down the process, but the % of successful submits <em>goes into space</em>.</p>

<h3 id="there-are-not-so-many-patterns-for-solving-problems-really">There are not so many patterns for solving problems. Really.</h3>

<p>I have almost <strong>stopped seeing something new</strong> in problem solving. Now I have solved about 380 tasks in total, and the solution of almost any task looks the same:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>look at the constraints of the problem, this gives an understanding of what asymptotics is expected from the solution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>find the pattern that is expected to be used in solving the problem, patterns can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">graph traversals</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary search</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dynamic programming</code> and so on …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>double-check that the patterns I have found are supposed to be used, this is easy enough to do by introducing invariants whose maintenance is guaranteed by the patterns I have chosen</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For an introduction to patterns, I suggest the following <a href="https://mm1705.github.io/leetcode-patterns/">[resource]</a></p>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>

<p>Besides basic things like compact graph traversal, all kinds of binary search (yes, it comes in left, right, and classical), I’ve picked up a couple of nice snippets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for el in itertools.chain(array, [TRIGGER])</code></p>

    <p>Sometimes when processing an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array</code> it is convenient to rely on the triggering of some event (<em>e.g., the change of a unique character in the example below</em>). This simplifies life, but requires additional logic in situations where the event does not occur (<em>e.g., for the last characters in the array</em>). This situation can be avoided by independently triggering the event at the right moment (<em>e.g., by expanding the initial array with a trigger symbol</em>).</p>

    <p>The example above is toy-like but demonstrative. In it, we can avoid adding a trigger, but then we would have to do an additional comparison at each iteration.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_ngbs</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), ...]</code></p>

    <p>When working with graphs (especially if they are represented by a chessboard or something similar), it is convenient to introduce a function that returns a list of neighbors.</p>

    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">condition</code> above can be, for example, the absence of obstacles or the freedom of the cell.<br />

    <p>When working with dynamic programming, where the order of element traversal is not obvious, you can put all the work on caching and recursion by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@lru_cache</code> decorator.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defaultdict(lambda: DUMMY_VALUE)</code></p>

    <p>Also in dynamic programming it is sometimes useful to set some default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DUMMY_VALUE</code>. For example, if recursive calculations are looking for the minimum of something, we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DUMMY_VALUE = float('inf')</code>. This will avoid checking that the element whose value we are accessing has already been retrieved at some point.</p>

<p>Path <strong>from</strong> <em>“count the number of characters”</em>  <strong>to</strong>  <em>“compress graph by going to graph on connected components, build common transitive vertex to reduce number of edges, set problem on state graph and solve it bypassing 0-1 BFS”</em>, or just <a href="https://yandex.ru/yaintern/algorithm-training"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Yandex.Training 3.0]</code></a> :D</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>I’ve already seen most of the problems from there in some form, but I really liked the last block. The concept of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">State Graph</code> is very cool, I recommend everyone to get acquainted.
You can find my solutions and the template with optimal and universal I/O <a href="https://github.com/zinchse/_contests">[here]</a>.</p>

<p>As a result, I took <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1-144</code>th place in the olympiad division, and was the first among those who were left without prizes, both in the both divisions. Interestingly, I wrote an algorithm with optimal asymptotics, which did not pass all the tests, and most of the time I tried to start it. But without success… So, after a couple of months I got back to this problem, and found something amazing (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">really :)</code>). About this I will report in a separate post.</p>

<p>The main experience that I took away from these trainings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Input/Output</code> is an important part of the problem</strong></p>

    <p>You have to think about how fast you read and write data. To combat this problem, I wrote a special <a href="https://github.com/zinchse/_contests/blob/main/yandex%20training%203.0/template.py">[template]</a> in which You need to organize only one function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">solve</code>, the data is processed by other methods in an optimal way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The problem’s input limits are the most important information in the problem’s definition</strong></p>

    <p>You can use them to figure out the asymptotic required solution. My advice is to assume that python can handle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10 ** 7</code> operations; then a solution with complexity <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n * n</code> for an input size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10 000</code> is not even worth writing, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n * logn</code> is fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Even simple arithmetic operations can be saved</strong></p>

    <p>If suddenly within a loop You repeatedly step to elements at some distance, for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d ** 3</code>, then by storing this value at each iteration in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shift</code> variable, You can significantly speed up the program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Iterating over rows and columns in a matrix, if they are represented by a list of lists, is not the same thing</strong></p>

    <p>Yes, this is quite a basic rule, but once in an asymptotically optimal solution I ran into this, and for a long time I could not understand what solution the authors of the problem expected from me… The reason for this phenomenon is the physical arrangement of array memory elements and random access speed</p>
